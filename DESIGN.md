# TastefulKit Design System

## Overview

This file is the project-level design source of truth for humans and AI coding agents. It follows the public Google Labs Code [`DESIGN.md`](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) alpha format: YAML design tokens first, then markdown guidance explaining how to apply them.

The default style is intentionally generic for a modern Django SaaS product: clean, trustworthy, accessible, and easy to customize after generation. Treat this as a starting point, not a permanent brand identity. The default register is product UI with marketing surfaces: authenticated screens should feel quiet and task-focused, while landing/pricing pages can be more expressive without becoming decorative.

When the product direction is clearer, update this file before making broad UI changes. Keep the tokens and prose aligned so different agents and tools produce consistent interfaces.

## Brand identity

The approved logo is the reference stack: three ascending, slightly slanted cards
representing a curated collection of real design references. The source vector is
`frontend/static/brand/reference-stack.svg`; the shared `brand_mark.html` component
pairs it with the existing bold, tightly tracked sans-serif TastefulKit wordmark.
Use the ink-colored mark on light surfaces and its white inversion on dark
surfaces. Keep the mark square and preserve the gaps between cards; never stretch
it or add gradients or shadows. The header/footer icon is 36px, with a 10px gap
before the wordmark. Browser/touch icons use the inverse mark on a dark tile.
`frontend/static/brand/social-preview.svg` is the editable source of the PNG
preview used for social sharing. Keep all brand variants consistent with the
reference-stack silhouette.

Arena uses `frontend/static/brand/arena-social-preview.png`, rendered from the
self-contained HTML in `frontend/src/brand/`. Keep its real reference comparison,
dark ink and terracotta palette, bold italic headline, and central VS. readable
at feed size. Its angled matchup composition is specific to this social artwork.

## Social previews

The homepage uses `frontend/src/brand/home-social-preview.html` and its 2× PNG.
Public utility pages and docs use `apps/pages/social_images.py`: warm paper, ink,
terracotta, the reference-stack mark, and a locally bundled Inter font (SIL OFL).
Design cards pair the title with the prepared thumbnail. These derivative images
never replace catalogue assets. Keep text within three measured lines, crop
reference previews from the top, and retain readable branding at feed size.

## Colors

The default palette uses practical SaaS neutrals with one confident primary color.

- **Primary (#15803D):** Main action color for CTAs, selected states, success-adjacent highlights, and the most important conversion path.
- **Secondary (#0F172A):** Deep slate for headlines, app chrome, and high-contrast UI surfaces.
- **Accent (#2563EB):** Secondary action/link color. Use it for navigation emphasis and informational affordances, not the main conversion path.
- **Neutral/Surface (#F8FAFC / #FFFFFF / #F1F5F9):** Light surfaces for pages, cards, forms, dashboards, and marketing sections.
- **Semantic colors:** Green for success, amber for warning, red for destructive or error states.

If your generated project needs a different brand, start by changing `primary`, `primary-hover`, `primary-soft`, and `accent`, then review button, badge, and link components.

Check contrast whenever colors move. Body copy, helper text, labels, placeholders, and disabled-but-readable text must meet WCAG AA contrast on both light and dark surfaces. Gray text on tinted backgrounds often fails; use a darker shade of the surface hue or move closer to `text`.

## Typography

Use a system sans-serif stack for speed, reliability, and low setup friction. Add a brand font later only if it improves the product enough to justify the dependency.

- **Headlines:** Bold with restrained tight tracking for landing pages, docs intros, and major empty states. Keep display tracking at `-0.04em` or looser.
- **Body:** 16px default with generous line height for readable forms, settings pages, docs, and dashboards.
- **Labels:** Medium-weight labels for form controls and action buttons.
- **Caps labels:** Reserve these for real metadata and status badges. Let headings stand on their own instead of adding decorative eyebrows.
- **Code:** Monospace for API examples, environment variables, commands, tokens, and identifiers.

Product UI should use fixed type sizes rather than viewport-fluid typography. Reserve hero-scale type for true public heroes; inside app panels, settings pages, dashboards, modals, and cards, keep headings compact enough that controls and content remain scannable. Use `text-wrap: balance` on headings and `text-wrap: pretty` on prose where supported.

## Layout

Use simple responsive layouts that work well for server-rendered Django pages.

- Keep page content inside a centered max-width container (`1200px`) with `24px` mobile-safe horizontal padding.
- Use generous vertical rhythm on marketing pages and tighter spacing in authenticated app screens.
- Use a single-column public hero by default: one clear promise, one short explanation, and one primary action. Put evidence and product detail in the following section rather than in a competing hero-side card.
- Prefer boring, predictable structure: single column on mobile, 2-column feature areas, and 3-column card groups only when content is truly symmetrical.
- Forms should be narrow enough to scan comfortably. Dashboards can use wider containers, but avoid dense data walls without hierarchy.
- Design empty, loading, error, and success states as first-class UI, not afterthoughts.
- Give fixed-format UI, such as toolbars, icon buttons, counters, tables, and cards, stable dimensions so hover states, labels, and dynamic content do not shift the layout.

## Elevation & Depth

Depth should come from borders, spacing, and subtle shadows.

- Default cards use light backgrounds, clear borders, and rounded corners.
- Use shadows only for overlays, menus, modals, and important hover states.
- Dark surfaces are reserved for headers, footers, code examples, and high-contrast hero sections.
- Avoid heavy glassmorphism, noisy gradients, and decorative effects that make forms or tables harder to read.
- Avoid the ghost-card pattern: a 1px border plus a large soft drop shadow on the same card, button, input, or panel. Pick a clear border or a purposeful elevation.

## Shapes

The default shape language is friendly but restrained.

- Use compact `10px`-`12px` radii for primary actions and navigation CTAs.
- Use `10px`–`16px` radius for inputs, cards, panels, and modal containers.
- Use full-radius badges for status labels.
- Keep radius choices consistent within each screen; inconsistency makes generated products feel stitched together.

## Components

- **Primary button:** Primary background, white text, compact radius, medium-bold label. Use for the single most important action in a section.
- **Secondary button:** White or muted background, slate text, border when needed. Use for navigation, cancel, and lower-priority actions.
- **Danger button:** Red background, white text. Use only for irreversible destructive actions and pair with confirmation UI.
- **Cards:** White/muted surfaces with rounded corners and borders. Keep one clear purpose per card.
- **Forms:** Visible labels, clear helper/error text, high-contrast focus rings, and full-width controls on mobile.
- **Navigation:** Use compact monospaced navigation, a restrained logo mark, clear current-page state, auth/account actions, and accessible native mobile behavior.
- **Page structure:** Prefer border-led sections and whitespace over walls of nested cards. Use cards only when the content is a genuinely independent object.
- **Tables/lists:** Prioritize scanability: sticky or repeated context where needed, muted metadata, and explicit empty states.
- **Docs/code blocks:** Monospace code, copyable commands when possible, and examples that match the generated project structure.

Every interactive component needs default, hover, focus-visible, active or selected when relevant, disabled, loading or pending when relevant, and error states. If a control can submit, delete, copy, save, authenticate, or navigate, design the state after success and failure before shipping it.

## Motion

Motion should communicate state, not decorate page load.

- Keep ordinary transitions around 150ms-250ms.
- Animate opacity and transform before layout properties.
- Do not hide content until JavaScript-triggered reveal animations run.
- Provide reduced-motion behavior with `prefers-reduced-motion`.
- Use skeletons or inline pending states for loading; avoid replacing useful context with a centered spinner.

## Frontend Quality Bar

Before shipping generated-project UI changes:

- Read `.agents/skills/frontend-ui-quality/SKILL.md` for the portable UI quality workflow.
- Check light and dark mode.
- Check mobile and desktop layouts for overflow, clipped menus, text collisions, and cramped buttons.
- Verify form errors, empty states, success messages, destructive confirmations, and disabled states.
- Keep repeated patterns in `frontend/src/styles/index.css` and update this file when changing tokens or component rules.

## Do's and Don'ts

- Do update this file when the brand, UI conventions, or component rules change.
- Do keep YAML tokens and markdown descriptions consistent.
- Do preserve WCAG AA contrast for text, buttons, alerts, and form states.
- Do design for both anonymous marketing pages and authenticated SaaS app screens.
- Do keep guidance agent-neutral: useful to humans and any coding agent.
- Don't hard-code maintainer names, domains, or one project's positioning into reusable UI guidance.
- Don't introduce a new font, color, radius, or shadow style for a single screen without updating the design system.
- Don't make AI-agent instructions vendor-specific; use plain project conventions and file paths.
- Don't let generated pages depend on remote design assets unless the project explicitly adds them.
- Don't use gradient text, colored side stripes, nested cards, repeated decorative card grids, over-rounded panels, or tiny uppercase section labels as default scaffolding.

## TastefulKit library identity

The public catalogue uses warm paper (#f8f7f3), dark ink (#242922), and terracotta (#b34424). Dark mode swaps to deep green-black and light warm text. Use system sans for product UI and Georgia italic for the hero's single “taste” accent. Catalogue screenshots provide the visual interest: no generated mock examples or invented activity counts. Shared rules live in frontend/src/styles/tastefulkit.css. The library grid is three/two/one columns at desktop/tablet/mobile; all controls retain keyboard focus states.

### Theme control

Use a 44px circular, outlined icon button after the navbar account actions
(to the right of Get started for guests). Show a stroked sun in light mode and
a crescent moon in dark mode, with an accessible label describing the switch
action. Reuse the same control in mobile menus, with the warm `--tk-*` palette
and visible keyboard focus.

### Documentation navigation

Docs use the product's monospace navigation and warm `--tk-*` colors: sentence-case
section labels, thin neutral separators, and compact 4px-radius links with a soft
neutral current-page state. Avoid orange pills, shadows, and tracked uppercase
labels. Keep the desktop list sticky and use a native, collapsed "Browse docs"
disclosure below 1024px so article content stays near the top on mobile. Mark the
current link with `aria-current="page"` and preserve keyboard focus indicators.

## Voting arena and rankings

Continue the catalogue's warm `--tk-*` palette, compact buttons, and restrained
10px image corners. Compare two equal-width screenshot panels on desktop and
stack them on narrow screens. Use the same preview height for both candidates,
with eager, high-priority thumbnails first and full screenshots decoded at low
priority after both previews settle. Keep the preview visible until its full image
is ready (or if loading fails); no-JS visitors can still vote from thumbnails.
Full reference pages remain accessible independently of voting. Never show global
scores beside a live comparison. Rankings use compact ordered rows with thumbnails,
visible sample counts, provisional labels, and distinct Global / For you tabs.
Personal-fit scores are relative, never percentages. Reset is an explicit,
confirmed action. All screens support keyboard input, no-JS forms, and dark mode.
